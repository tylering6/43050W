            <h3>The engineering design process is a systematic approach that helps high school robotics teams effectively design, build and test their robots. 
                By following this process, teams can ensure they address all the necessary requirements and optimize their chances for success in competitions. 
                The engineering design process also helps clearly see what needs to be looked at and changed along the way.
                Here's a detailed breakdown of how we use this process in our team.</h3>
            <section>
                <h2>1. Define the Problem</h2>
                <p>Understand the Game: Review the rules and objectives of the current VEX Robotics game. Identify the key tasks the robot needs to perform (e.g., scoring points, lifting objects, navigating obstacles). </p>
                <p>Requirements and Constraints: Determine the specific requirements the robot must meet and any constraints, such as size, weight, and budget.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>2. Research and Brainstorm</h2>
                <p>Research Existing Designs: Look at previous robots and designs that have been successful in past competitions. This can provide inspiration and ideas.</p>
                <p>Brainstorm Solutions: As a team, brainstorm different ideas for robot mechanisms and strategies. Encourage creativity and consider multiple approaches to each problem.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>3. Specify Requirements</h2>
                <p>Functional Requirements: Define what functions the robot must perform (e.g., move, pick up objects, score).</p>
                <p>Performance Criteria: Establish criteria for how well the robot should perform these functions (e.g., speed, accuracy, reliability).</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>4. Develop Concepts</h2>
                <p>Sketch and Model Ideas: Create sketches and preliminary models of different design concepts. Use software tools like CAD (Computer-Aided Design) to visualize the designs.</p>
                <p>Evaluate Concepts: Assess the feasibility, strengths, and weaknesses of each concept. Use decision matrices or other evaluation tools to compare them.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>5. Select the Best Solution</h2>
                <p>Select a Design: Based on the evaluations, select the most promising design concept. Ensure it meets all the defined requirements and constraints.</p>
                <p>Refine the Design: Make necessary adjustments and refinements to the selected design.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>6. Develop a Detailed Design</h2>
                <p>Create Detailed Drawings: Develop detailed drawings and specifications for the robot. This includes dimensions, materials, and components.</p>
                <p>Plan the Build: Outline the steps needed to build the robot. Identify any special tools or materials required.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>7. Build and Program the Robot</h2>
                <p>Construct the Robot: Follow the detailed design and build the robot. This may involve cutting, assembling, and fastening various components.</p>
                <p>Program the Robot: Develop the software needed to control the robot. This includes writing and testing code for movement, sensors, and autonomous functions.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>8. Test and Evaluate</h2>
                <p>Initial Testing: Conduct initial tests to ensure the robot functions as expected. Identify any issues or areas for improvement.</p>
                <p>Iterative Testing: Perform iterative testing and refinement. This may involve several cycles of testing, identifying problems, making adjustments, and retesting.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>9. Improve and Optimize</h2>
                <p>Analyze Performance: Analyze the robot’s performance during testing. Focus on areas where it underperforms or could be more efficient.</p>
                <p>Make Improvements: Implement design and programming improvements based on test results. Optimize for performance, reliability, and ease of use.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>10. Compete and Learn</h2>
                <p>Participate in Competitions: Use the robot to compete in VEX Robotics competitions. Gather data and feedback from the competition experience.</p>
                <p>Reflect and Document: Reflect on what worked well and what didn’t. Document lessons learned and ideas for future improvements.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>11. Iterate and Innovate</h2>
                <p>Continuous Improvement: Apply lessons learned to future designs. Continuously innovate and iterate on the design process to enhance the robot’s capabilities and performance.</p>
